# **Event Finder Application ** #

This is an Event Finder application that allows you to search for your city of interest, and find events that are occurring at local venues. The cities are saved in the Firebase database, and stored as buttons on the front-end. The user can revisit the previously searched city by clicking the city button located at the top of the page. A Youtube video will display next to the event so the user can listen and view the artist/comedian/band that is performing.
